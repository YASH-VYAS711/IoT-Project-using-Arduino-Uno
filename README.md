# IoT-Project-using-Arduino-Uno
I developed an Arduino-based robotic car with obstacle avoidance, Bluetooth navigation, and voice recognition. Using ultrasonic
sensors, the car navigates autonomously, avoids collisions, and can be controlled via smartphone or voice commands, showcasing my
hardware and software integration skills.
